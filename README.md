Build a simple HTML/JS app preferably based on AngularJS v1 which, when you open the site, asks for a permission to read your current location, and then uses the http://openweathermap.org/current public API to fetch the weather for that location and displays it.

If the user denies to share the location, show a little input form for entering postcode or country, and display the weather based on that location.
